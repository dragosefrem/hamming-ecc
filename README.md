# hamming-ecc
Verilog program that receives a data input on 32 bits and returns the data output on 32 bits, where the flipped bit is corrected. If there are more than one bit flips, then a signal will be activated stating so. Corrections are made based on Hamming's code. Small project made during my second year of Computer Engineering studies at Polytechnic University of Timi»ôoara
